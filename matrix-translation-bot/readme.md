To use this bot, you simply need to change the `homeserver_url` value to the server where your bot account lives. You also need to change `YOUR_BOTS_PASSWORD` with your own password, and `YOUR_DEEPL_API_KEY` with the key you can get at deepl.org

Then just run the main.rs file and it should work. It'll say "Ready" in the console if it's working.

Requires Matrix version 1.5 or newer and Rust 2021 or newer.
