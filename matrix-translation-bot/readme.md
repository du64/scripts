To use this bot, you simply need to change the `homeserver_url` value to the server where your bot account lives. You also need to change `YOUR_BOTS_PASSWORD` with your own password, and `YOUR_DEEPL_API_KEY` with the key you can get at deepl.org

Then just run the main.rs file and it should work. It'll say "Ready" in the console if it's working.
